It is a time to remember when the Jewish people were slaves in Egypt and how they became free. During Passover, families come together to tell the story of their ancestors and to celebrate freedom.\nMany years ago, the Jewish people were slaves in Egypt. They worked very hard and were not allowed to leave. But one day, a man named Moses came and told Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to let his people go. Pharaoh said no, so God sent ten plagues to convince him. The last plague was the worst one. God told the Jewish people to put lamb's blood on their doors, so the angel of death would pass over their houses. That's why it's called Passover.\nWhen Pharaoh finally agreed to let the Jewish people go, they left Egypt in a hurry. They didn't have time for their bread to rise, so they baked flat bread called matzah. During Passover, we eat matzah to remember this time.\nOn the first night of Passover, families gather for a special meal called a Seder. We retell the story of our ancestors using a book called the Haggadah. We sing songs, ask questions, and eat symbolic foods like bitter herbs and charoset. These foods remind us of the bitterness of slavery and the sweetness of freedom.\nPassover is a time to remember our history and to be grateful for our freedom. It is a special holiday filled with traditions and family. I am excited to celebrate Passover and learn more about my heritage."}
